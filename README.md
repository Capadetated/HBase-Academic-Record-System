# HBase-Academic-Record-System

A HBase theory discussion and practical example using an academic record system.

This was an HBase-based project which discussed the major concepts of HBase/Hadoop and then described theoretically setting up an academic records system. The latter discussion described some of the hardware and software requirements for moving from an outdated records system to a new scalable one that could store a hundred million users.

"HBase Academic Record System_Fitch.pdf" contains the text of the analysis along with the supporting tables. "Pseudocode_Fitch.pdf" contains the pseudocode written to support the analysis.
